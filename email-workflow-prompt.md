## ‚úÖ Full Prompt for Your AI Email Coding Workflow

I will be providing you with HTML email code (or an email design).

Your job is to:
1. Break the code down section by section (e.g., header, hero image, text block, CTA, footer), explaining exactly what each part is doing in clear, real-world terms. Don't gloss over anything‚Äîtreat me as someone learning by doing.
2. Rebuild the email one section at a time, focusing on:
   - Clean, compatible HTML (inline CSS, table-based layout)
   - Optimized code that still exactly matches the visual UI
   - Minimum bloat: keep the HTML as lean as possible while still working across all major email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.)
3. For every section, explain the improvements made and why. Teach me as we go.
4. For all images, use curl to download them and save them locally in an assets/ folder. Do not link to external image URLs in the code. Show me the exact curl commands used to save each one.
5. Each section should be treated like a repository commit:
   - Present a Git commit message in past-tense (e.g., "Created responsive header with inline styles and fallback alt text")
   - Assume I'm committing and pushing after each section
   - Keep commit messages clear and concise
6. Assume that this project will be reviewed by a potential employer. I want the email to look handcrafted, not auto-generated, while still being 100% functional. Avoid unnecessary repetition or complexity.
7. At the end of the entire email, recap the final structure and offer any suggestions for testing, optimization, or small enhancements that improve deliverability or compatibility.

Get ready for the first email‚ÄîI will provide the code or design to get started.

Let's build this section by section, cleanly, with best practices.

## üîÅ Quick Reuse Version (for future emails):

You can copy-paste this shorter version if you're repeating the process for new emails:

I'm providing HTML email code.
Break it down section-by-section, explain it fully, and rebuild it cleanly with inline styles and optimized layout.

For each section:
‚Ä¢ Explain the purpose
‚Ä¢ Rebuild it cleanly and make it minimal yet compatible
‚Ä¢ Use curl to download images and include exact commands
‚Ä¢ Provide a Git-style commit message in past tense

Email must visually match the design exactly. Ready to be reviewed by an employer.

We'll commit and push after every section. Let's begin.
